## Assignment Notes:

Upon hovering over specific parts of the primary navigation: 

1. The logo turns blue (#6178A6).

2. The hamburger menu turns blue (#6178A6).

3. Links become underlined.

The three images in the Modal window (boa, sweater & sunglasses) do not display in the small view.

The dropdown navigation in the small view “Does not need to work!”.

The first media query stop is at 980 pixels (the small view ends), then the page gracefully scale up to 1440 pixels and then is constrained in the viewport centre at larger widths.

The nav of the main page is sticky.

The “More New Arrivals You’ll Love” section contains a horizontal navigation component that contains twelve items.  Please duplicate the six provided.

The “Privacy Policy” link in the modal window should open the “Privacy.html” page.

The Privacy page displays a long ream of textual content.  It does not require any further formatting than what is described in the provided view.  The text in the small view will fill 90% of the viewport.

The “Return to Home” link on the privacy page should open the Index page and is in a fixed position in the viewport.  It will be on top of the text in the small view.

The background of the Privacy page fills the full screen and is fixed in position (parallax).
